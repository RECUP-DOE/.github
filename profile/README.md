# RECUP: Scalable Metadata and Provenance for Reproducible Hybrid Workflows
We develop methods to enable the reproducibility of performance and scientific results for numerical and data-intensive simulations orchestrated by workflows that run on high performance systems.
The RECUP web site is available here [https://sites.google.com/view/recup-reproducibility/home]

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
